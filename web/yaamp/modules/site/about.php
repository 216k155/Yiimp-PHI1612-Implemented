<h2>A few words to present the site and myself</h2>

<div style='padding-left: 25px; width: 640px;'>

<p>Although i've been exposed by friends who are mining bitcoin or some other dogecoin
for a little while already, i'm pretty new to the cryptocoin mining universe. I do like
the concept of cryptocurrency for many reasons. One of them being certainly to lessen the
monetary policy control from the few hands. Cryptocurrencies seem well suited to something
that looks like a libertarianism political philosophy. That's probably going to be a very
slow and long term shift, but i guess that's a step toward freedom and democracy. Numbers
would normally eventually outweigh the few. Another reason is because it's fun.</p>

<p>I must say that it's the maxcoin launch that really got my attention. Because mining
early is good and because i feel Max Keiser is a relevant voice for cryptocurrencies. I
got myself a decent GPU and started mining maxcoin. I've got a few by mining at 1gh.com
for a week. It did the job very well. Then i've been aware of a possible 51% attack on
cryptocurrency. I really don't think 1gh.com would mess with anything, but still, that's
an issue. As there are already many other mining pools, it looks like anonymous mining is
popular. Especially at maxcoin launch when they all got ddosed. I went from one to
another before i got something working on 1gh.com. Then i agreed that anonymous mining
is great and my password paper notebook had enough. </p>

<p>I understand the only available implementation out there is not anonymous. Everyone has
the same stratum-mining + MPOS implementation. Only 1gh.com and dwarfmining seem to have
their own original modified implementation or i didn't find correctly. So i saw there an
opportunity for another anonymous mining pool. For a whole day, i tried to refrain myself
from this crazy idea of making another mining pool. I'm some kind of compulsive coder. I
do it for a living and i do it for fun. And that's the kind of project i like.</p>

<p>Crazy idea because there aren't much chances for success. I mean nobody is going to
come to an empty mining site. The opportunity window is very early at the coin launch
when low hashpower can still find blocks. Even though it was a few days late to start
such a project for maxcoin, the next day, that was too strong, i had to do it. Else i
was stuck from doing my other projects.  In any way, if i'm going to be involved in the
cryptocurrency world, it's going to be also as a programmer or at hacking here and there
sooner or later. That was also an opportunity to jump in some python code.</p>

<p>This server is online for at least one year. I do have other servers for other projects
too. They are so cheap. So i'll continue to plug in my miner (and play a little less world
of warcraft) and look forward to acquire more hashpower. But another thing i get from this
last weekend journey is some knowledge of the technology so i can think about contributing
to the programming effort whenever i can and be ready whenever there's another interesting
coin launch.</p>

<p>Now i can go back to work,</p>

<p>Long life to maxcoin,</p>
